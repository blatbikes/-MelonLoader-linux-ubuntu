its not detecting the game and .steam (where the game is installed) wont show up

It sounds like MelonLoader isn't detecting your game installation because of how Steam handles game directories on Linux. Here‚Äôs how to fix it:
üõ† Fixing MelonLoader Not Detecting Your Game
1Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Locate Your Game Directory

Since .steam is a hidden folder, Steam games are usually installed in:

~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common

To navigate to it, open a terminal and run:

cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common
ls

This will list all installed games. Find the correct folder for your game.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run MelonLoader with the Game Path

Try running the installer and manually specifying the game directory:

./MelonLoader.Installer.Linux --game /home/yourusername/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/YourGameFolder

Replace yourusername with your actual Linux username and YourGameFolder with your game‚Äôs name.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Make Hidden Folders Visible (GUI)

If you prefer using a file manager:

    Open your home directory.
    Press Ctrl + H to show hidden folders.
    Navigate to .steam/steam/steamapps/common/YourGameFolder.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Use Steam‚Äôs Library Path

If your Steam games are installed on another drive, check where Steam is installed by running:

grep 'BaseInstallFolder' ~/.steam/steam/config/libraryfolders.vdf

It will show where your game directories are located.
üöÄ Try These If It Still Doesn‚Äôt Work

    Run the installer with sudo:

sudo ./MelonLoader.Installer.Linux

Move the installer to the game folder and run it from there:

    mv MelonLoader.Installer.Linux ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/YourGameFolder
    cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/YourGameFolder
    ./MelonLoader.Installer.Linux

im on ubuntu and the game is Schedule 1 and my steam user is yrdoodoo

I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble installing MelonLoader for "Schedule 1" on your Ubuntu system. Let's address the issues you're encountering:
1. Game Detection Issue

MelonLoader may not automatically detect the game if it's installed in a hidden directory like .steam. To resolve this:

    Manually Specify the Game Path:

    Open a terminal and run the installer with the --game parameter, providing the full path to your game's executable. For example:

    ./MelonLoader.Installer.Linux --game "/home/yrdoodoo/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Schedule 1/Schedule1.x86_64"

    Ensure you replace Schedule1.x86_64 with the actual executable name if it differs.

2. Accessing Hidden Directories

The .steam directory is hidden by default. To navigate to it:

    Using the Terminal:

  cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Schedule\ 1/

    Using the File Manager:
        Open your home directory.
        Press Ctrl + H to toggle the visibility of hidden files and folders.
        Navigate to .steam/steam/steamapps/common/Schedule 1/.

3. Ensure Necessary Permissions

MelonLoader requires write access to the game's directory. To ensure it has the necessary permissions:

    Change Directory Ownership:

  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER "/home/yrdoodoo/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Schedule 1/"

    Set Directory Permissions:

  sudo chmod -R 755 "/home/yrdoodoo/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Schedule 1/"

4. Install Required Dependencies

Some games may require additional dependencies. Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

    Install Mono:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install mono-complete

    Install .NET 6.0 Runtime:

  wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install dotnet-runtime-6.0

5. Alternative Installation Method

If the standard installer isn't working, consider manual installation:

    Download MelonLoader:

    Visit the MelonLoader GitHub Releases page and download the latest version.

    Extract Files:

    Extract the contents to your game's directory:

unzip MelonLoader.x.x.x.zip -d "/home/yrdoodoo/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Schedule 1/"

Set Executable Permissions:

Ensure the version.dll and other necessary files are executable:

chmod +x "/home/yrdoodoo/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Schedule 1/version.dll"
